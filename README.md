# Wise_Tree_5G_at_UBC
Tweeting talking red oak tree at the University of British Columbia's Point Grey campus. The tree tweets and converses with people about tree conditions in real time, such as if the tree is in distress, as well as other topics such as the cultural and heritage of the red oak at UBC's Main Mall. The tree's communications are made possible due to the Rogers' 5G network on campus.
