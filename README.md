# The Wise Trees 5G Project at UBC
The University of British Columbia is home of approximately 8,000 trees planted and over 10,000 native trees in natural settings. The Point Grey campus's cultural heritage includes a nearly kilometre long line of mature red oaks lining the Main Mall.

In this project, we study the natural and urban environmental effects on the red oak trees and soil on 2 green spaces on campus. We embed sensing devices along red oak trees to measure trees' level of distress in response to effect variations as well as provide a data-driven insight into the direct and indirect effects of climate change on the campus' red oaks and natural assets.    


# "If trees could talk, what would they say?" 

We're connecting sensors for red oaks to tweet updates about their natural sway/dynamics, the sap-flow/water intake, and how the different parameters correlate with trees' distress levels. Monitoring such parameters provides us with insight into the trees' level of distress as well as some of the urban effects on those levels, such as crowd analytics within trees' proximities. 

In addition to tweeting, we're setting up a voice assitant (Alexa) for students to get to know the trees and trees' heritage! The trees tweet and converse with people about tree conditions in real time, such as if the trees are in distress due to water shortage for example, as well as other topics such as the cultural heritage of the red oak at UBC's Main Mall. The trees' communications are made possible due to the 5G network on campus.  

What would a project be if we didn't take construction into account? We're also measuring (air quality), noise levels, and their corresponding effects on distress levels in red oak. As for students, lo-fi construction noises will help with the nostolgic feeling of hearing construction noises on campus all the time. We're thinking about using noise levels to tweet places people should avoid throuhgout the (construction) day.
